# FastAPI User and Friendship Management API

This FastAPI application provides a CRUD interface for managing users and their friendships. The relationships between users are bidirectional, meaning that if two users are friends, this can be verified from either userâ€™s perspective. The application is asynchronous, leverages MongoDB as the database, and is fully containerized using Docker.

## Features

### Backend

- **Framework**: FastAPI `0.111.0`
- **Language**: Python `3.12`
- **Database Driver**: Motor `3.1.1` (asynchronous version of PyMongo)

### Database

- **MongoDB Version**: `6.0.3`
- **Collections**:
  - `user_collection`: Stores user information.
  - `friendship_collection`: Stores bidirectional friendships between users.
- **Database Initialization**: On startup, the database and a non-root user with read/write access are created.

### General Characteristics

- **Dockerized Deployment**: The application uses Docker Compose for deployment, creating two containers (`api` and `mongo_database`).
- **Environment Configuration**: All environment variables are managed through a `.env` file.
- **Asynchronous Structure**:
  - `core/`: Configuration settings.
  - `database/`: MongoDB connection drivers.
  - `helpers/`: JSON conversion utilities.
  - `models/`: Data models.
  - `requirements/`: Project dependencies.
  - `routes/`: API endpoints definitions.
  - `schemas/`: Response schemas for endpoints.
  - `tests/`: Automated tests for the application.
  - `Dockerfile`: Defines the backend Docker image.
  - `main.py`: Entry point for the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation and Execution

1. **Configure the environment variables**:

   ```bash
   cp .env-example .env
   ```

2. **Build and execute the containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Access the API documentation**:

### Running Tests

1. **Profile Creation**: Create a specified number of profiles in the database.

   ```bash
    docker exec -it backend_test /bin/sh -c "python tests/profile_creation.py <Number of Profiles>"
   ```

2. **Friendship Creation**: Randomly generate friendships between existing users.

   ```bash
    docker exec -it backend_test /bin/sh -c "python tests/create_relations.py <Number of Friendships>"
   ```
